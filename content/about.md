#### Work

Hi, my name is Guilherme Leobas. I am currently working at [@quansightai](https://twitter.com/quansightai)
as a Software Engineer. Before joining Quansight, I was a MSc student at the Federal University of
Minas Gerais ([dcc/ufmg](https://www.dcc.ufmg.br/dcc/?q=en)) working with compiler optimizations
under the supervision of professor [Fernando Magno](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~fernando/).

As part of my work at Quansight, I have contributed to a number of open source softwares:

- [Numba](https://github.com/numba/numba/pulls/guilhermeleobas), a NumPy aware JIT compiler using LLVM
- [RBC](https://github.com/xnd-project/rbc/pulls/guilhermeleobas), a remote JIT compiler built on top of Numba
- [OmniSciDB](https://github.com/omnisci/omniscidb/commits?author=guilhermeleobas), one of the fastest SQL engine in the world
- [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pulls/guilhermeleobas), an open source ML framework

#### Free time

I am also an amateur triathlete. Follow me on [Zwift](https://www.zwift.com/athlete/81969471-9f8a-4541-bbdd-9f2780109bd4)
and we can cycle together someday.
